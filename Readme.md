# EFF wordlist in columns

I wanted to make the [EFF's wordlist](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/07/new-wordlists-random-passphrases) easier to use "manually".

So I hacked together this script to generate a PDF of the EFF Random Passphrase wordlist to be easy to search through.

Regenerate the pdf by running `make`.
(requires `ghostscript`, `enscript`, and various `coreutils`).

Verified to work on osx, but should work in Linux.
