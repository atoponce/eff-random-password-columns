# EFF wordlist in columns

I wanted to make the wordlist easier to use "manually".

So I hacked together this script to generate a Pdf of the eff diceware wordlist to be easy to search through.

RE-generate the pdf by running `make`.

# TODO
1. I should add a makefile target to pull the latest wordlist
